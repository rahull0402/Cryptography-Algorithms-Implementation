Cryptography Algorithms Implementation üîê
This project provides a command-line implementation of fundamental cryptographic algorithms in Python. It's designed as an educational tool to demonstrate the core concepts of symmetric encryption (AES), asymmetric encryption (RSA), and cryptographic hashing (SHA-256) through a simple, interactive interface.

‚ú® Features
AES (Advanced Encryption Standard): Implements symmetric encryption and decryption for text data.

RSA (Rivest‚ÄìShamir‚ÄìAdleman): Includes key pair generation, asymmetric encryption, and decryption.

SHA-256 (Secure Hash Algorithm): Generates a 256-bit (32-byte) hash value from text input.

Interactive CLI: A user-friendly menu-driven interface for easy operation.

üöÄ Getting Started
Follow these instructions to get the project running on your local machine.

Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python 3.8 or newer installed on your system. You can check your Python version with the following command:

Bash

python --version
Installation
Clone the Repository
Clone the project to your local machine.

Bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/Cryptography-Algorithms-Implementation.git
Navigate to the Project Directory

Bash

cd Cryptography-Algorithms-Implementation
Install Required Libraries
The project relies on the cryptography library. Install it using pip.

Bash

pip install cryptography
üíª Usage
To run the application, execute the main.py script from the root of the project directory.

Bash

python main.py
Once running, the application will present you with a menu. Simply enter the number corresponding to the operation you wish to perform:

1 ‚Üí AES Encryption & Decryption: Encrypt a message with a password and then decrypt it.

2 ‚Üí RSA Encryption & Decryption: Generate an RSA key pair, encrypt a message with the public key, and decrypt it with the private key.

3 ‚Üí SHA-256 Hashing: Generate a SHA-256 hash for a given text input.

‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer
This project is intended for educational and demonstrational purposes only. The cryptographic implementations provided here are basic and should not be used in production environments or for securing sensitive data. Real-world cryptographic applications require robust key management, secure protocols, and adherence to industry best practices.
