 ## Cryptography Algorithms Implementation üîê


This project provides a command-line implementation of fundamental cryptographic algorithms in Python. It's designed as an educational tool to demonstrate the core concepts of symmetric encryption (AES), asymmetric encryption (RSA), and cryptographic hashing (SHA-256) through a simple, interactive interface.

## ‚ú® Features

AES (Advanced Encryption Standard): Implements symmetric encryption and decryption for text data.

RSA (Rivest‚ÄìShamir‚ÄìAdleman): Includes key pair generation, asymmetric encryption, and decryption.

SHA-256 (Secure Hash Algorithm): Generates a 256-bit (32-byte) hash value from text input.

Interactive CLI: A user-friendly menu-driven interface for easy operation.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

This project is intended for educational and demonstrational purposes only. The cryptographic implementations provided here are basic and should not be used in production environments or for securing sensitive data. Real-world cryptographic applications require robust key management, secure protocols, and adherence to industry best practices.
